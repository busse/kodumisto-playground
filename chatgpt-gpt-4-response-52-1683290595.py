To accomplish this task, we can use the math.ceil function in Python's math module to round up the division result. Below is a Python script containing a function that calculates the number of cases needed:

```python
import math

def calculate_cases_sold(bottles_sold: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the number of cases of hull cleaner sold based on the number of bottles sold.

    Args:
        bottles_sold: The number of bottles of hull cleaner sold.

    Returns:
        The number of cases of hull cleaner sold.
    """
    cases_sold = math.ceil(bottles_sold / 12)
    return cases_sold

# Example usage
bottles_sold = 130  # Replace this with the actual number of bottles sold in a given week
cases_sold = calculate_cases_sold(bottles_sold)
print(f"Cases of hull cleaner sold: {cases_sold}")
```

Replace the `bottles_sold` variable with the actual number of bottles sold in a given week to calculate the cases sold. The script will round up if there is any remainder greater than 0.

Remember to install the math module if you haven't already done so by running:

```
pip install math
```

in your command prompt or terminal.
