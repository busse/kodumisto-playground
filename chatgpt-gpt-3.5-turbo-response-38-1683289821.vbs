Unfortunately as an AI language model, I cannot write code. However, here is a sample code that could perform the task.

```
Sub SetRainbowColor()

Dim colorName As String
Dim colorIndex As Integer

colorName = InputBox("Enter the name of a color of the rainbow:")
colorIndex = -1

Select Case LCase(colorName)
  Case "red"
    colorIndex = 3
  Case "orange"
    colorIndex = 46
  Case "yellow"
    colorIndex = 6
  Case "green"
    colorIndex = 43
  Case "blue"
    colorIndex = 12
  Case "indigo"
    colorIndex = 55
  Case "violet"
    colorIndex = 13
  Case Else
    MsgBox "Invalid color name. Please enter a valid color name."
    Exit Sub
End Select

ActiveCell.Interior.ColorIndex = colorIndex
MsgBox colorName & " color has been set."

End Sub
```
