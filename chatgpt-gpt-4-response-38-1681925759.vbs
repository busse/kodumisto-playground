To create a Visual Basic script for Excel that changes the background color of a cell based on the English name of a rainbow color, you need to use the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) programming language. Here's a simple VBA script that you can use:

1. Open Excel and press `Alt + F11` to open the Visual Basic for Applications editor.

2. Click `Insert` > `Module` to create a new module.

3. Copy and paste the following code in the module:

```vba
Sub SetRainbowColor()

    ' Declare variables
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim cell As Range
    Dim colorName As String

    ' Set the worksheet and range
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.ActiveSheet
    Set rng = ws.UsedRange

    ' Loop through each cell in the range
    For Each cell In rng
        ' Get the color name from the cell's value
        colorName = LCase(cell.Value)

        ' Set the cell background color based on the color name
        Select Case colorName
            Case "red"
                cell.Interior.Color = RGB(255, 0, 0)
            Case "orange"
                cell.Interior.Color = RGB(255, 165, 0)
            Case "yellow"
                cell.Interior.Color = RGB(255, 255, 0)
            Case "green"
                cell.Interior.Color = RGB(0, 128, 0)
            Case "blue"
                cell.Interior.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255)
            Case "indigo"
                cell.Interior.Color = RGB(75, 0, 130)
            Case "violet"
                cell.Interior.Color = RGB(238, 130, 238)
        End Select
    Next cell

End Sub
```

4. Press `Ctrl + S` to save the module.

5. Now go back to Excel and press `Alt + F8` to open the Macro dialog.

6. Select `SetRainbowColor` and click `Run` to execute the macro.

This VBA script will loop through all the used cells in the active worksheet. If a cell contains a rainbow color's English name (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, or violet), the cell's background color will be changed to that color.
